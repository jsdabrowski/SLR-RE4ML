# SLR-RE4ML
Requirements Engineering For Machine Learning Systems: A Systematic Literature Review

The repository contains suplementary materials for our systematic literature review. They are part of the journal submission. The materials include:

- data etraction form ("SLR-RE4ML-data-extraction-form.xlsx")
- database storing the meta-data of surveyed papers ("SLR-RE4ML-bibliography.bib")
- list and references to publicly-available supplementary materials ("supplementary-materials.csv")

We hope the new knowledge proviaded in our SLR will contribute to improving the quality of requirements engineering.
